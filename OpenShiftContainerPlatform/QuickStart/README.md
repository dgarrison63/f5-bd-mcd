# OpenShift Container Platform

This is a placeholder read me for the Multi-CLoud POC quick start guide. This guide is being written and will be available soon. However it is primarily based on the steps detailed in the Red Hat documentation below. Just follow the 5 node design found in the "Single Master Examples" section of the documentation to build your OpenShift Container Platform clusters. Very soon a step by step guide similar to the Ansible Tower guide will be published to this repo.
