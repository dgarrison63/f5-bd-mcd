# BIG-IP

NOTE: This part of the repo is in work.

In this architecture we will be deploying several BIG-IPs however it is important to note that with the exception of minor details related to each cloud / On Premises target the set up remains the same. I will cover the per cloud differences in the upcoming detailed guides

Here we will be covering cloud specific deployments. To begin we will need to provision the BIG-IP, acquire a license, and apply it to the BIG-IP.
